              hunger. Many people are too busy scrambling for food and survival to worry about the rest in that era.
              Frank Diköttere wrote in "Mao's Great Famine" that women in the Great Famine had to endure mental pressure, physical
              pain, psychological inferiority as well as humiliation. Most of this torture came from gender discrimination.</b></p><br>
              <p align="left"><b>Women had to undertake hard physical work, and they also had
                to shoulder the responsibility of caring for the elderly and children. Mrs. Chen, who celebrated her 60th birthday
                this year, recalled: "My father passed away early. At that time, my mother supported my family like a man." Under the impact of collectivization, China overturned the moral norms passed down from generation to generation,
                resulting in many abnormal behaviors. Sexual humiliation, sex trading, and heavy social responsibility exhausted
                women physically and mentally at that time. </b></p><br>
              
          <p align="left"><b>China has achieved remarkeble accomplishments in the past 50 years.
              Mrs. Wang, who was born in the 1960s, admires modern young women.
              "They live in abundance, and they can do whatever they want without caring about other people's
              comments which is a life I dare not imagine as a child. " Mrs. Chen also said: "Social development is inseparable
              from women, which
              consequently provides women with many opportunities. Therefore, women are becoming more and more independent and
              confident." </b></p><br>
          <p align="left"><b>The economic reforms of China provided more employment opportunities for women. Women's extensive
              participation in the labor market has built up the foundation for women to obtain financial independence and
              eliminate their economic dependence on their husbands. The rapid development of China's economy has also spawned
              several female entrepreneurs who have attracted worldwide attention. They are a symbol of women's strength and a
              typical representative of women's economic independence. </b></p><br>

        </p><br>
        <p align="left"><b>First, the health status of women has improved significantly, and the reproductive health of rural
            women has remarkably improved. A notable change is that the percentage of rural women under the age of 35 who gave
            birth in hospitals has increased by 40.6 percentage points from a decade ago. The corresponding percentage change in
            urban areas is 9.7.

          <p align="left"><b>The concept of sharing housework is well accepted, and men are more involved in housework
              than
              before. 88.6% of the respondents agreed that "men should also take the initiative to undertake housework".
              Accordingly, the survey also shows that the time of housework of women in both urban and rural areas has
              decreased
              significantly.</b>
          </p><br>

              non-governmental mutual aid and self-help organizations is higher than that of men.</b>
          </p><br>

          <p align="left"><b>The gender gap in education has impressively reduced. The mean years of education
              for women have an increase of 2.7 years compared with 2000,the gender gap narrowed to 0.3 years from the 1.5 years
              of a decade ago. And the proportion of women who have received
              high

          <p align="left"><b>In addition, women's autonomy in deciding personal affairs has improved. 95% of women can
              satisfy
              their shopping desire and support their parents based on their opinoins. And men and women are more equal in making
              decisions
              on family affairs. Wives have a greater say in dome investment, loans, and other important decisions,
              and
              the
              proportion of this item is 14.3 percentage points higher than ten years ago.</b></p><br>
          
          <p align="left"><b>Another noteworthy advancement is that the awareness of the <i>Law on the Protection of
          
                Rights
                and Interests of Women</i> has increased significantly. According to the survey, the number of people who know

              status of
              Chinese women has greatly improved compared with the past. After satisfying the basic needs of life, Chinese women's
              self-consciousness awakened and
              developed
              gradually, and they began to put forward the demand for more dignified lives and equal status.</b>
          </p><br>

                <p align="left"><b>Some people may wonder why Chinese women are not satisfied with so many things they already
                  have and
                  what the feminists are pursuing for now. Like the shadow under the sun, these rising satisfactory numerals
                  cover so
                  much unseen bitterness and sorrow. The social and cultural environment is not friendly enough towards
                  Chinese women
                  compared to men. Women are confronted with domestic violence, sexual exploitation, heavy housework,
                  workplace
                  harassment, gender discrimination, and many other endless problems. These social problems, like a knife that will fall on one's' head at any time, deeply troubled Chinese women. </b>
              </p><br>
    
    
              <p align="left"><b>In 2012, five Chinese feminists were arrested on a charge of picking quarrels and provoking trouble
                  on the eve of Women's Day 2015. They once called for opposition to domestic violence, protested the inequality
                  between men and women in Chinese society, and used performance art to fight for the rights of Chinese homosexuals.
                  Their arrest was regarded as a turning point in Chinese feminism activism history. <a href="https://time.com/5453927/china-feminist-five-big-brother-leta-hong-fincher-interview/" target=_blank>Hong Fincher acknowledged</a> the importance of  their actions to international solidarity
                  in the fight for women’s rights.</b></p><br>
              <p align="left">
                <b>However, on Chinese social media, feminists
                  such as Zheng Churan, Li Maizi, and Lv Pin, are accused of generating gender antagonisms and hyping negative
                  public
                  opinion and are "in league with anti-China forces".  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-41406010" target=_blank>Li Maizi,
                    one of the feminist movement organizers, said</a>: "China's political environment is unprecedentedly tense, and some
                  things that were once legal are now illegal. Feminism has been politicized and stigmatized, causing
                  the
                  feminist movement to fall into a trough."

                  poorly in terms of gender equality level in the past 15 years. Last year, the Health and survival index even ranks
                  in last place. What's worse, China's gender equality process has almost stagnated and even regressed. WEF believes
                  that it will take another 100 years for China to build a gender-equitable society. Chen Zhi, a girl who actively
                  discussed gender equality, said, "Life and health are the most fundamental human rights. Neither of them is adequately

          <p><b>In Saudi Arabia, women will not be disturbed by unfamiliar men in public places and will be protected by male
              family members when they go out; Similarly, an Arab princess can enjoy a luxurious life without worrying about
              earning money. She even does not need to work, she can stay at home, and her father and brother will bear living
              expenses. It seems a paradise for women, but it does not manifest these Arabian countries' women's privilege. On the
              contrary, women are regarded as a vulnerable group in Saudi. Their male family member will influence their life
              trajectory. Since men provide all the material needs that women need, it is natural that this woman becomes an
              accessory to men. In other words, if women want to be respected and treated equally, they first need to be separate
              themselves from the identity of "male accessories". Arabian women are aware of this
              and have begun to seek the right to live free.</b>

        <p><b>In 2017, the chairman of the Saudi Stock Exchange, the CEO of Samba Financial Group, and the CFO of Arab National
            Bank were successively held by women. Not only that, with the lifting of the female driving ban in 2018, female
            drivers have also become a new trend. According to <a href="https://qz.com/work/1676120/glowork-helps-women-in-saudi-arabia-enter-the-workforce/"></a>Quartz, in 2019</a>, 23% of Saudi women entered the labor market,
            which is a considerable improvement for Saudi Arabia compared with 18% ten years ago. At the same time, more and
            more people are beginning to understand and support women's work.

        </p>
        <p><b>However, some Chinese KOLs advocate "female enjoyment," consumerism, and male hatred. They propose that men should
            spend money for women, buy gifts for girls during festivals and reshape women into roles that need to rely on men. It
            is natural for women to receive preferential treatment from men. Erich Fromm (1956) critically pointed out that alienation is
            everywhere in modern society, and the development of capitalism makes people fall into the trap of commodity fetishism.

          <br>
          <p><b>One typical example is the increasingly stringent
            "wedding tradition" in China. In recent years, the bride price increased higher and higher, the highest up to 300,000.
            Before marriage, the man needs to give the woman a bride price; later, the man has to
            afford the wedding expenses; he can also not marry the woman, but he will lose part or all of the bride price paid.Under this theory of materialized marriage, all factors such as age, health, appearance, knowledge, wealth, and
              ideas possessed by an individual are regarded as life assets. Bride-price tradition can be traced back to the ancient
              feudal society in China. The man paid the woman's parents; after that, she will take on family responsibilities, for
              example, looking after their parents-in-law, doing housework, and serving her husband. </b>
          </p>

          <p><b>With the progress of society and the liberation of human rights, women no longer have to bear social oppression. Since
            women have exempted the feudal society's obligation, they will lose their rights
            to a high bride price. Li Benji, a human rights research scholar, believes: "Most women shrink back from the actual
            obligations that accompany their rights, and they are not willing and do not dare to undertake these duties." They request gender equality, while unwilling to let go of a pampered life, then their determination to live on an equal footing is fake.</b>
          </p>
  
  
  
          <p><b>If women don't make efforts to
              change from
              themselves, the gender discrimination left over by history can't change automatically. Without quantitative change, people can
              never make a
              qualitative change. Modern women's rights are based on their economic self-determination and spiritual independence. Rights
              never
              depend on others for charity, but on oneself to fight for them. The equality of men and women means that
              duties and
              rights undertaken by men and women are equal. If a person only wants to enjoy his rights without performing
              his
              obligations, it's nothing less than self-destruction.</b>

          <p><b> After 1949, under the influence of Marxism, China called for the abolition of class emancipation and human
              rights, women were liberated as "oppressed" classes in this trend. Following the trend of the times, women
              participated in socially productive labor and gained independent income, thus launching a large-scale gender
              equality movement across the country. Therefore, the status of Chinese women has risen sharply.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>At present, China's feminism is in a spontaneous rather than conscious stage, and it is under pressure
          counterattack driven by pain and stimuli. Women's rights were relatively insignificant in equal progress
          compared to
          the achievement made before liberation. Miss Jiao from Hubei said: "Women's status has been greatly improved compared to
          before, but most people still have gender discrimination. Although gender equality has been advocated in our country for
          years, I think the effect is minimal." As for what
          needs to
          be achieved in the next stage of gender equality, modern China does not seem to have an accurate goal.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Modern social media provides a direction for women. It is a significant development that the rise of social
              media
              has made it easier for individuals who are
              originally isolated and helpless to gain public support through social media. At the same time, the female-led
              consumption model is deeply changing the business model, “Her Economic” comes into being. Chinese media cater
              to the thinking methods of independent women to express, which has indeed alleviated the pressure on women in
              real
              society to a great extent. These business promotions have established a lot of independent and self-reliant
              images
              of women and
              created a relatively friendly environment for women on the Internet. For example, an advertisement released by
              Johnson & Johnson in 2019 describes three mothers of different times. That modern mother is a medical worker.
              After
              receiving the anti-epidemic task, she devotes herself to the place where she is more needed, to realize her
              personal
              value.</b></p>

              to comfort women in virtual posts, but profit-seeking. It cannot bring about substantive changes to gender
              equality. Chen Hao (2018) analyzes postmodern feminism based on the theory of empowerment. For women to truly gain
              more
              rights, it
              is not enough to gain the right to speak. What is more important is women's own knowledge of themselves,
              and their
              thinking on philosophical propositions such as "who am I" and "what do I want to do". </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>It's much harder
              to say what
              you want than just saying "no". Because if you imform what you want, you will give people a lot of
              opportunities to
              refute you and restrict you. It seems that you have lost a lot of power. However, determining, claiming, and
              pursuing what you want, are part of the real essence of rights, as defined by Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld (1913).</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>It is inevitable to discuss the standard behavioral norms. Any group that wants to strive for a common goal
              as a
              whole must have a joint program of action. It is necessary to be clear about what can and cannot be done. In
              this
              way, people will not use their rights unscrupulously and will not lose their way in the fight.

          <p><b>Looking back on the history of Western feminist development, it is inseparable from the joint efforts of
              groups.

              movement of the
              19th century. In 1848, the first feminist conference was held in Seneca Falls, New York. In 1903, Emmeline
              Pankhurst
              established the Women's Social and Political Union, intending to expose the institutionalized gender
              discrimination
              in British society.

              the

              accounts
              have slowly disappeared on Chinese social media. <a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20210426/china-feminism-weibo/">The New York Times </a>reported that at least 15 famous

              working conditions and low wages made women workers respond to the call of equal rights activists, hold protests and
              demonstrations, and finally, they succeeded. Women’s activities in civil society are the main driving force for the
              change of legislation in a direction that is beneficial to women. In the 1950s, a 22-year-old rural girl, Shen Jilan
              from Shanxi Province turned "equal wages for equal work" into a living fact in China. At that time, even in most
              developed countries, women worldwide could not even achieve basic "equal work," let alone "equal pay." </b></p><br>

          <p><b>The male is still the most powerful group in China nowadays. Generally speaking, male violence against other
              groups happens the most and is the most serious. Men are usually the most favored in the workplace, and educational
              resources are also biased towards men.
          </b>
          </p>
          
          <p><b>The term feminism can be traced back to several equal rights movements in the last century. From women's demand
              for voting rights to broader civil rights, such as equal pay for similar work, equal education, and safer public
              space, the needs of each stage are different from the core of justice. It also overlapped with the racial equality
              movement and the LGBT movement in the middle and late last century.
            </b>

          <p><b>However, "feminism" is interpreted by some people to be extremely radical and highly exclusive in mordern China.
              When a feminist puts forward the term "feminism," it means that she will express her position on gender issues,
              including stereotyped influences,
              traditional concepts of gender roles, and so on. When wife killings and domestic violence continue to occur and have
              not yet been cut off, Chinese women complain about the lack
              of extensive judicial assistance and social concern.
              The disappointment experienced by
              Chinese women under gender oppression is likely to be projected on specific male groups and even individuals. <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/818155/china-perceptions-on-defining-themselves-as-feminist-by-gender/">The
                report of Statista</a> shows that 31% of men defined
              themselves as feminists. These men who do not have the will to oppress women may think this accusation is
              groundless. This emotional commonality and common hostility
              produce invisible groups, and then there is the phenomenon of group polarization, and the whole group becomes
              extremes. Women began to hate men, and men believed that women deserved it, and the two sides were in a deadlock.
            </b>
          </p>

          <p><b>Chen Jiming, a male student, believes that it's just as shocking in most news related to direct violations of life
            and body, whether the victim is a man or a woman. Both women and relatively disadvantaged groups among men are
            affected by gender inequality . It is more important to find out why it happened and solve it.</b></p>
          
          <p><b>Due to the development of the
              Internet, women's awareness of equal rights has been repeatedly discussed on the Internet. However, apart from
              online platforms, many women in the real world are still in dire straits. Most people who advocate feminist rights
              online are fairly young women with knowledge and cultural literacy. They are only in Utopia and have not experienced
              cruel gender discrimination, said Yang Wenting (2021). Under such a circumstance, the current Chinese feminist cannot unite
              women, and allies are therefore not available.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Miss Jiao appreciates the way women unite and fight for women's rights and interests bit by bit, starting from
              small things. "Fierce sports are not desirable. Now in a society ruled by law, I don't think it has reached the
              point where it is irretrievable." Among the 1,000 interviewees, 55% believe that the essential part of the future
              gender equality process should be
              women's performance in the political field.Many feminists who actively participate in gender issues on the Internet seem
              to be unaware that the affirmative slogans they put forward are incompatible with most women. Lacking allies and
              establishing numerous enemies, China's feminist rights are more like a weapon used by a small group of people to attack
              dissidents. Chinese feminists should prevent feminism from becoming a gimmick and deeply challenge vested interests. The
              feminist movement should push it to where it is needed more.

          <p><b>Although there are many differences within feminism, its purpose is to require women's liberation, independence,
              and equal rights with men. The wrong concept of feminism is the most significant resistance to the feminist movement
              in contemporary society, said Mu Qiaoyun (2020). If women want to obtain absolute independence and equality, they must
              abandon the dualistic thinking mode. Women should emancipate their ideology and eliminate the opposition between the
              sexes. Women have always been a part of society, and women who want a better life cannot be separated from other groups. Women should tolerate all kinds of groups and ideas and find more allies to get support from all sides. Only when feminists achieve natural harmony between men and women will equal rights become true.

          <p><b>Looking back over the past 50 years, the quality of life of Chinese women has benefited from the improvement of
              the economic level of the whole country and women's participation in the labor market. Although there are still many deficiencies compared with western countries,
              the emergence of outstanding women in all walks proves that the status of Chinese women will be higher and higher.
              Women's equal rights consciousness is about women getting a better life in modern society, being generally
              respected, and avoiding unnecessary losses because of gender. It is not the idea that women should have a higher
              status than men, and women should be more respected than men. Women's rights are not about women's higher status but
              equality between men and women. If we can mutually understand and respect, the future of equality will eventually be
              realized.
