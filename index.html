          <p align="left"><b>In the 1960s, Chinese people experienced an extreme lack of daily necessities and the
              hardships of
              hunger. Many people are too busy scrambling for food and survival to worry about the rest in that era.
              Frank Diköttere wrote in "Mao's Great Famine" that women in the Great Famine had to endure mental
              pressure, physical
              pain, psychological inferiority as well as humiliation. Most of this torture came from gender
              discrimination.</b></p><br>

              to shoulder the responsibility of caring for the elderly and children. Mrs. Chen, who celebrated her 60th
              birthday
              this year, recalled: "My father passed away early. At that time, my mother supported my family like a
              man." Under the impact of collectivization, China overturned the moral norms passed down from generation
              to generation,
              resulting in many abnormal behaviors. Sexual humiliation, sex trading, and heavy social responsibility
              exhausted

              "They live in abundance, and they can do whatever they want without caring about other people's
              comments which is a life I dare not imagine as a child. " Mrs. Chen also said: "Social development is
              inseparable
              from women, which
              consequently provides women with many opportunities. Therefore, women are becoming more and more

            who gave

        <p align="left"><b>The concept of sharing housework is well accepted, and men are more involved in housework
            than
            before. 88.6% of the respondents agreed that "men should also take the initiative to undertake housework".
            Accordingly, the survey also shows that the time of housework of women in both urban and rural areas has
            decreased
            significantly.</b>

        <p align="left"><b>In addition, women's autonomy in deciding personal affairs has improved. 95% of women can
            satisfy
            their shopping desire and support their parents based on their opinoins. And men and women are more equal in
            making

              Rights

            social
            status of
            Chinese women has greatly improved compared with the past. After satisfying the basic needs of life, Chinese
            women's
            self-consciousness awakened and
            developed
            gradually, and they began to put forward the demand for more dignified lives and equal status.</b>

        <p align="left"><b>Some people may wonder why Chinese women are not satisfied with so many things they already
            have and
            what the feminists are pursuing for now. Like the shadow under the sun, these rising satisfactory numerals
            cover so
            much unseen bitterness and sorrow. The social and cultural environment is not friendly enough towards
            Chinese women
            compared to men. Women are confronted with domestic violence, sexual exploitation, heavy housework,
            workplace
            harassment, gender discrimination, and many other endless problems. These social problems, like a knife that
            will fall on one's' head at any time, deeply troubled Chinese women. </b>
        </p><br>


        <p align="left"><b>In 2012, five Chinese feminists were arrested on a charge of picking quarrels and provoking
            trouble
            on the eve of Women's Day 2015. They once called for opposition to domestic violence, protested the
            inequality
            between men and women in Chinese society, and used performance art to fight for the rights of Chinese
            homosexuals.
            Their arrest was regarded as a turning point in Chinese feminism activism history. <a

            in the fight for women’s rights.</b></p><br>
        <p align="left">
          <b>However, on Chinese social media, feminists
            such as Zheng Churan, Li Maizi, and Lv Pin, are accused of generating gender antagonisms and hyping negative
            public
            opinion and are "in league with anti-China forces". <a

            things that were once legal are now illegal. Feminism has been politicized and stigmatized, causing
            the

        <p align="left"><b> The World Gender Gap Report (WGGR) released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that
            China ranks

            ranks
            in last place. What's worse, China's gender equality process has almost stagnated and even regressed. WEF
            believes
            that it will take another 100 years for China to build a gender-equitable society. Chen Zhi, a girl who
            actively

          <p align="left"><b>On the eve of the founding of China, the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political
              Consultative Conference" clearly stipulated that women have equal rights with men in politics. In
              addition,
              China
              has enacted several laws for women to provide exceptional protection for their rights and interests. For
              example, it
              stipulates the scope of labor work for female employees, guarantees the right of female employees to rest
              in
              particular periods, and ensures that women obtain the right to social security. </b></p><br>

          <p align="left"><b>However, China's current legal system is not mature. On the one hand, when formulating
              laws,
              the
              legislature adhered to the legislative concept of "broad rather than detailed" and did not complete the
              details of
              some relevant regulations; on the other hand, the social development is too fast, and new problems emerge
              one after
              another. These laws previously formulated can no longer meet the needs of the new situation.</b></p><br>
          <p align="left"><b>Sexual harassment in the workplace is nothing new. The law stipulates that employers are responsible for prohibiting sexual harassment, but the lack of details makes it still a severe problem. And women as vulnerable people are the
              main victims in the workplace. <a

                survey</a> showed that 66.5% of women had experienced sexual harassment in the
              workplace, and nearly 50% of women are told sex-related jokes during meals. In addition, from the
              perspective of existing laws, the ex-post remedies for sexual harassment are relatively limited. Victims
              are faced with problems such as high litigation costs, low trial efficiency, and difficulty in obtaining
              evidence. After winning the case, victims will receive very little financial compensation, and they may
               lose their jobs and suffer from mental health issues. In December 2018, a female employee sued her
              boss for sexual harassment. This case lasted for two years, and finally, the employee only received "a
              written or verbal public apology."</b></p>

              people do not abide by the law.
              <i>Article 23 of the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests</i>: "When
              hiring
              female
              employees, all units shall not stipulate restrictions on the marriage and childbirth of female employees."
              According to <a href="http://www.199it.com/archives/1154831.html">employment data</a>, nearly 90% of married women
              have been asked about their birth plans when applying for a job. Some interviewers require job applicants to
              guarantee "not getting married within two years"
              and "not
              having children within three years." 35% of bosses started hiring replacement candidates after they learned that
              their subordinates were pregnant.
              These employers have raised the employment standards of female job seekers and violated women's right to
              work and
              reproductive rights. 
            </b></p>

            suitable for
            women announced by the state. However, "Men only" job advertisements are common at multiple job fairs. In
            2021, the
            National Civil Servant Examination recruited 9336 positions, of which 2130 positions preferred to hire

            some
            civil service jobs are specified as "men only," "men
            preferred," or "suitable for men." In view of this situation, Mr. Yu, a human resources manager, believes,
            "The best
            way
            is to

            courier because the courier needed to deliver heavy goods for a long time, citing the rules from
            <i>Provisions on Labor Protection of Female Post and Telecommunications Workers</i>. Mahu sued the company
            for
            "gender

            women's employment. 
            The law
            and
            society should change the stereotype of women, and women should loosen the shackles of the traditional
            concept. Yi Yi, a lawyer, suggested that "when the law cannot take care of women

              treat

        <p align="left"><b>Women's Day originated from the political events initiated by socialist feminists. At that
            time, poor
            working conditions and low wages made women workers respond to the call of equal rights activists, hold
            protests and
            demonstrations, and finally, they succeeded. The feminist movement in Western countries is an indispensable part of the
            pursuit of equal rights for men and women, and the activities of civil society are the main driving force to promote
            changes in legislation in a direction that is beneficial to women. Although similar social activities are rare in China, China has a tradition of feminist movement.
          </b></p><br>
        <p align="left"><b>In the 1950s, a 22-year-old rural girl,
          Shen Jilan
          from Shanxi Province turned "equal wages for equal work" into a living fact in China. At that time, even
          in most
          developed countries, women worldwide could not even achieve basic "equal work," let alone "equal pay." In 1952, half a year after Shen Jilan successfully achieved equal work in the village,
            Prefectural
            Committee discovered her deeds in a coincidence. It was then turned into a gender equality
            movement
            promoted across the country, and more and more female industry representatives emerged. She is a
            well-deserved
            pioneer of Chinese feminism. Facts have also proved that Chinese women can make remarkable achievements
            under the
            correct leadership.

        <p align="left"><b>In China, at present, all kinds of feminist thoughts are in a state of chaos. 
            Society requires women to actively fight for women's work, education, and autonomy, but it does not tell
            women what methods should be used to strive for it. Some feminists have learned Western experience and
            brought it to China to create a path with Chinese characteristics. However, when such a person appears,
            people will first analyze her political position and personal experience. Before they reached the
            achievement of advancing the equality process, these ideas were swamped by nationalism. </b></p><br>

            matter. She
            exposed on the Internet to call for implementing a smoking ban and tobacco control in public places. And then, she launched a joint campaign of "Rejecting Second-hand Smoke" and "Against Gender Violence in Public Places".

              to 300,000.
              Before marriage, the man needs to give the woman a bride price; later, the man has to
              afford the wedding expenses; he can also not marry the woman, but he will lose part or all of the bride

              knowledge, wealth, and

              to a high bride price. Li Benji, a human rights research scholar, believes: "Most women shrink back from
              the actual
              obligations that accompany their rights, and they are not willing and do not dare to undertake these
              duties." They request gender equality, while unwilling to let go of a pampered life, then their
              determination to live on an equal footing is fake.</b>
          </p>



          <p><b>If women don't make efforts to
              change from
              themselves, the gender discrimination left over by history can't change automatically. Without
              quantitative change, people can
              never make a
              qualitative change. Modern women's rights are based on their economic self-determination and spiritual
              independence. Rights
              never
              depend on others for charity, but on oneself to fight for them. The equality of men and women means that
              duties and
              rights undertaken by men and women are equal. If a person only wants to enjoy his rights without
              performing
              his
              obligations, it's nothing less than self-destruction.</b>

          <p>iv.Extremely Feminist Ideology</p>
          <p><b>The male is still the most powerful group in China nowadays. Generally speaking, male violence against
              other
              groups happens the most and is the most serious. Men are usually the most favored in the workplace, and
              educational
              resources are also biased towards men.
            </b>
          </p>

          <p><b>The term feminism can be traced back to several equal rights movements in the last century. From women's
              demand
              for voting rights to broader civil rights, such as equal pay for similar work, equal education, and safer
              public
              space, the needs of each stage are different from the core of justice. It also overlapped with the racial
              equality
              movement and the LGBT movement in the middle and late last century.
            </b>

          <p><b>However, "feminism" is interpreted by some people to be extremely radical and highly exclusive in
              modern China.
              When a feminist puts forward the term "feminism," it means that she will express her position on gender
              issues,
              including stereotyped influences,
              traditional concepts of gender roles, and so on. When wife killings and domestic violence continue to
              occur and have
              not yet been eliminated, Chinese women complain about the lack
              of extensive judicial assistance and social concern.
              The disappointment experienced by
              Chinese women under gender oppression is likely to be projected on specific male groups and even
              individuals. <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/818155/china-perceptions-on-defining-themselves-as-feminist-by-gender/">The
                report of Statista</a> shows that 31% of men defined
              themselves as feminists. These men who do not have the will to oppress women may think this accusation is
              groundless. This emotional commonality and common hostility
              produce invisible groups, and then there is the phenomenon of group polarization, and the whole group
              becomes
              extremes. Women began to hate men, and men believed that women deserved it, and the two sides were in a
              deadlock.

          <p><b>Chen Jiming, a men who is concerned about gender equality, believes that it's just as shocking in most news related to direct
              violations of life
              and body, whether the victim is a man or a woman. Both women and relatively disadvantaged groups among men
              are
              affected by gender inequality . "The keypoint is not on gender, but on finding out why and how to solve it."</b></p>

          <p><b>Due to the development of the
              Internet, women's awareness of equal rights has been repeatedly discussed on the Internet. However, apart
              from
              online platforms, many women in the real world are still in dire straits. Most people who advocate
              feminist rights
              online are fairly young women with knowledge and cultural literacy. They are only in Utopia and have not
              experienced
              cruel gender discrimination, said <a href="http://www.zetsg.com/qikan/4ae1a239d9276f4e0729dfe1d65c6226.html">Yang Wenting</a>. Under such a circumstance, the current Chinese
              feminist cannot unite
              women, and allies are therefore not available.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Among the 1,000 interviewees, 55% believe that the essential part of the
              future
              gender equality process should be
              women's performance in the political field.Many feminists who actively participate in gender issues on the
              Internet seem
              to be unaware that the slogans they put forward are incompatible with most women. Lacking
              allies and
              establishing numerous enemies, China's feminist rights are more like a weapon used by a small group of
              people to attack
              dissidents. Chinese feminists should prevent feminism from becoming a gimmick and deeply challenge vested
              interests. The
              feminist movement should push it to where it is needed more.

          <p><b>Although there are many differences within feminism, its purpose is to require women's liberation,
              independence,
              and equal rights with men. The wrong concept of feminism is the most significant resistance to the
              feminist movement

              equality, they must
              abandon the dualistic thinking mode. Women should emancipate their ideology and eliminate the opposition
              between the
              sexes. Women have always been a part of society, and women who want a better life cannot be separated from
              other groups. Women should tolerate all kinds of groups and ideas and find more allies to get support from
              all sides. Only when feminists achieve natural harmony between men and women will equal rights become
              true.

          <p><b> After 1949, under the influence of Marxism, China called for the abolition of class emancipation and
              human
              rights, women were liberated as "oppressed" classes in this trend. Following the trend of the times, women
              participated in socially productive labor and gained independent income, thus launching a large-scale
              gender
              equality movement across the country. Therefore, the status of Chinese women has risen sharply.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>At present, China's feminism is in a spontaneous rather than conscious stage, and it is under pressure
              counterattack driven by pain and stimuli. Women's rights were relatively insignificant in equal progress
              compared to
              the achievement made before liberation. Miss Jiao who works in the machinery industry said: "Women's status has been greatly
              improved compared to
              before, but most people still have gender discrimination. Although gender equality has been advocated in
              our country for
              years, I think the effect is minimal." As for what
              needs to
              be achieved in the next stage of gender equality, modern China does not seem to have an accurate goal.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Modern social media provides a direction for women. It is a significant development that the rise of
              social
              media
              has made it easier for individuals who are
              originally isolated and helpless to gain public support through social media. At the same time, the
              female-led
              consumption model is deeply changing the business model, “Her Economic” comes into being. Chinese media
              cater
              to the thinking methods of independent women to express, which has indeed alleviated the pressure on women
              in
              real
              society to a great extent. These business promotions have established a lot of independent and

              images
              of women and
              created a relatively friendly environment for women on the Internet. For example, an advertisement
              released by
              Johnson & Johnson in 2019 describes three mothers of different times. That modern mother is a medical
              worker.
              After
              receiving the anti-epidemic task, she devotes herself to the place where she is more needed, to realize
              her
              personal

        <p><b>Looking back over the past 50 years, the quality of life of Chinese women has benefited from the
            improvement of
            the economic level of the whole country and women's participation in the labor market. Although there are
            still many deficiencies compared with western countries,
            the emergence of outstanding women in all walks proves that the status of Chinese women will be higher and
            higher. Wu Xiao is hopeful about future development. She said, "It's progress that feminism, which was previously
            inconspicuous, is now beginning to gain social attention. Nowadays, women's awareness of independence is becoming
            stronger and stronger, which is also a manifestation of progress. Perhaps the progress is slow now, but when our
            generation becomes the main force of society, the road of gender equality will not be so difficult."</b></p>
            
            <p><b>Advocating gender equality is very important to all aspects of a healthy society. According to Amartya Sen's
                theory, development is a process in which all people expand all kinds of freedoms equally, and gender equality
                itself is a core development goal. Gender equality is everyone's business, and everyone needs to strive for it. If
                we can understand and respect each other, an equal future will eventually come true.
