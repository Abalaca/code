              comments which is a life I dare not imagine as a child. "Mrs. Chen, who celebrated her 60th birthday this year, said: "social development is inseparable
              from women, which
              consequently provides women with many opportunities. Therefore, women are becoming more and more independent and

        <p align="left"><b>First, the health status of women has improved significantly, and the reproductive health of rural

            birth in hospitals has increased by 40.6 percentage points from a decade ago. The corresponding percentage change in
            urban areas is 9.7.

              than
              before. 88.6% of the respondents agreed that "men should also take the initiative to undertake housework".
              Accordingly, the survey also shows that the time of housework of women in both urban and rural areas has
              decreased

              of a decade ago. And the proportion of women who have received

          <p align="left"><b>In addition, women's autonomy in deciding personal affairs has improved. 95% of women can
              satisfy
              their shopping desire and support their parents based on their opinoins. And men and women are more equal in making
              decisions

          <p align="left"><b>Another noteworthy advancement is that the awareness of the <i>Law on the Protection of
          
                Rights

              status of
              Chinese women has greatly improved compared with the past. After satisfying the basic needs of life, Chinese women's
              self-consciousness awakened and
              developed
              gradually, and they began to put forward the demand for more dignified lives and equal status.</b>

              cover so
              much unseen bitterness and sorrow. The social and cultural environment is not friendly enough towards
              Chinese women
              compared to men. Women are confronted with domestic violence, sexual exploitation, heavy housework,
              workplace
              harassment, gender discrimination, and many other endless problems. These social problems, like a chopper
              that will
              fall on ones' head at any time, have deeply disturbed Chinese women. </b>
          </p><br>


          <p align="left"><b>In 2012, five Chinese feminists were arrested on a charge of picking quarrels and provoking trouble
              on the eve of Women's Day 2015. They once called for opposition to domestic violence, protested the inequality
              between men and women in Chinese society, and used performance art to fight for the rights of Chinese homosexuals.
              Their arrest was regarded as a turning point in Chinese feminism activism history. <a href="https://time.com/5453927/china-feminist-five-big-brother-leta-hong-fincher-interview/" target=_blank>Hong Fincher acknowledged</a>the importance of  their actions to international solidarity
              in the fight for women’s rights.</b></p><br>
          <p align="left">
            <b>However, on Chinese social media, feminists
              such as Zheng Churan, Li Maizi, and Lv Pin, are accused of generating gender antagonisms and hyping negative
              public
              opinion and are "in league with anti-China forces".  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-41406010" target=_blank>Li Maizi,

        <p><b>It is not a manifestation of Saudi women's privilege. On the contrary, it is because women are regarded as a
            vulnerable group in Saudi. Similarly, an Arab princess can enjoy a luxurious life without worrying about money
            at
            the cost of freedom. Her father and brother will influence her life trajectory. Since men provide all the
            material
            needs that women need, it is natural that this woman becomes an accessory to men. In other words, if women
            want to
            be respected and treated equally, they first need to be self-respect. Saudi women are aware of this, and they
            have

            willing
            and do not dare to undertake these duties." The most typical example is the consumerism advocated by modern
            capitalist society. Some Chinese KOLs advocate "female enjoyment," consumerism, and male hatred. They propose
            that
            men ought to spend money on women and buy gifts for girls during festivals. It is natural for women to receive
            preferential treatment from men.

          <p><b>At present, China's feminism is actually in a stage of spontaneous rather than self-conscious, a
              stressful
              counterattack driven by pain and stimulation. Women's rights after liberation were quite insignificant in
              terms of
              legislative progress compared to the achievement made before liberation.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>After 1949, the sharp rise in the status of Chinese women was not on account of what women have done,
              but a
              top-down political policy. This policy was determined by Marxism, which called for the elimination of
              class
              liberation human rights, and women were liberated as "oppressed" classes in this trend. Women have
              improved their
              quality of life without making too much effort. As a result, women, later on, do not know what they should
              do.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>It is an important development that the rise of social media has made it easier for individuals who were
              originally isolated and helpless to gain public support through social media. At the same time, Chinese
              media cater
              to the way of thinking of independent women to express, which has indeed alleviated the pressure on women
              in real
              society to a great extent. However, the nature of commercial is not to comfort women in virtual posts, but
              profit-seeking. These business promotions have established a lot of independent and self-reliant images of
              women,
              and also create a relatively friendly environment for women on the Internet.
            </b>
          <p><b>Chen Hao analyzes postmodern feminism based on the theory of empowerment. For women to truly gain more
              rights, it
              is not enough to gain the right to speak. What is more important is women's own knowledge of themselves,
              and their
              thinking on philosophical propositions such as "who am I" and "what do I want to do". </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Summarizing all the "dons" cannot be equated to what you have declared what you want. It's much harder
              to say what
              you want than just saying "no". Because if you say what you want, you will give people a lot of
              opportunities to
              refute you and restrict you. It seems that you have lost a lot of power. However, even so, determining,
              claiming,
              and pursuing what you want is still part of the real essence of rights, as defined by Hohfeld N.W.
              (1903).</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>The emergence of a clear program will limit the possibility of women's rights doing whatever they want.
              It is inevitable to discuss the common behavioral norms. Any group that wants to strive for a common goal
              as a whole
              must have a common program of action. Such a program cannot only include “don's" and "oppose” but must
              also include
              goals other than objections. And this goal must logically regulate the common behavior of the organization
              members based
              on whether it is conducive to the realization of the goal, and the emergence of a clear program will limit
              women's
              rights and ensure that it will not act willfully.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Looking back on the history of Western feminist development, it is inseparable from the joint efforts of
              groups.

              movement of the
              19th century. In 1848, the first feminist conference was held in Seneca Falls, New York. In 1903, Emmeline
              Pankhurst
              established the Women's Social and Political Union, intending to expose the institutionalized gender
              discrimination
              in British society.

          </p>

              the

              structural explanations for gender inequality or domestic violence, the explanation will make many people
              feel

              turned "equal

          <p align="left"><b>In the countryside at that time, without any reference materials, Shen had to overcome many
              deep-rooted prejudices and difficulties. She mobilized women in the co-operative to work in the fields

              the one hand, women faced physical inconvenience, on the other hand, working with men is regarded as a
              disgraceful

          <p align="left"><b>The underlying logic is that Chinese people should have only one group value system to

          <p><b>The Male is still the most powerful group in China nowadays. Generally speaking, male violence against
              other
              groups happens the most and is the most serious. Men are usually the most favored in the workplace, and
              educational
              resources are also biased towards men. </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>In 2020, when wife killings and domestic violence continue to occur and have not yet been cut off, in
              the views of
              most feminists, feminist rights are not completely equal to "equal rights". The term "equal rights" that
              includes
              "male rights" and "feminist rights" appears to be less popular.</b>
          </p>
          <p><b>The term feminism can be traced back to several equal rights movements in the last century. From women's
              demand
              for voting rights to broader civil rights, such as equal pay for equal work, equal education, and safer
              public
              space, the demands of each stage are different from the core of justice. It also overlapped with the
              racial equality
              movement and the LGBT equality movement in the middle and late last century.
            </b>
          <p><b>When a feminist puts forward the term "feminism", it means that she will express her position on gender
              issues,
              including stereotyped influences, traditional concepts of gender roles, and so on. It also means that she
              will
              specifically care about gender topics, with corresponding critical tools. Some radical feminist rights
              will
              emphasize "female" and adopt extreme isolationism towards other genders. </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>These people will emphasize the identity of the biological sex and believe that physiological gender is
              a gap that
              hinders people's mutual understanding, and different genders can never cross it. Such aggressive gender
              opposition
              cognition has led to confrontation and mutual distrust between men and women. Chinese women complain about
              the lack
              of extensive social union foundation, practical system, and judicial assistance. The disappointment
              experienced by
              Chinese women under gender oppression is likely to be projected on specific male groups and even
              individuals. And
              then, these men who do not have the will to oppress women may think this accusation is groundless. </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>What can unite a group is often the common enemy. Therefore, this emotional commonality and common
              hostility
              produce invisible groups and form an invisible program to restrict the behavior of all members. Then there
              is the
              phenomenon of group polarization, and the whole group becomes extremes. Thus, reflexive anti-feminism was
              formed. At
              this time, anti-feminism is not only addressing some uncomfortable statements but a thing that must be
              done in order
              to maintain their group existence. The individual will is affected to some extent by the invisible
              collective will,
              therefore, feminists themselves created enemies. The report of Statista shows that 31% of men defined
              themselves as
              feminists. Since this is the case, do not push away this part of the masses and make them become the enemy
              of women.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Some feminist activists who appeared online tarnish the reputation of feminism. Due to the development
              of the
              Internet, women’s awareness of equal rights has been repeatedly discussed on the Internet. However, apart
              from
              online platforms, a considerable number of women in the real world are still in dire straits. Most of the
              people who
              advocate feminist rights online are fairly young women with knowledge and cultural literacy. They are only
              in Utopia
              and have not experienced cruel gender discrimination, said Yang Wenting. Under such a circumstance, the
              current
              Chinese feminist cannot way to unite women, and allies are therefore not available.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p><b>Chinese feminists should prevent feminism from becoming an artifice of empty talk, and challenge those
              with vested
              interests more deeply. And the feminist movement should get rid of the shackles of the interests of the
              middle class
              and push it to places where it is more urgently needed. At least it can be asserted that the breaking of
              the old
              system must come from an objective examination of the world, society, and even itself.
          </p>
          <p><b>Although there are many differences within feminism, its purpose is to require women's liberation,
              independence,
              and equal rights with men. In contemporary society, the wrong concept of feminism is the biggest
              resistance to the
              feminist movement, said Mu Qiaoyun. If women want to obtain real independence and equality, they must
              abandon the
              dualistic thinking mode. Women should not only emancipate their ideology but also eliminate the opposition
              between
              the sexes. Only when feminists achieve real harmony between men and women, will equal rights become true.

          <p><b>Looking back over the past 50 years, the quality of life of Chinese women has benefited from the
              improvement of
              the economic level of the whole country. Although there are still many deficiencies compared with western
              countries,
              the emergence of outstanding women in all walks proves that the status of Chinese women will be higher and
              higher.
              Women's equal rights consciousness is about women getting a better life in modern society, being generally
              respected, and avoiding undue losses because of gender. It is not the idea that women should have a higher
              status
              than men, and women should be more respected than men. Women’s rights are not about women’s higher status,
              but for
              equality between men and women. If each of us can mutually understand and respect, the future of equality
              will
              eventually be realized.
